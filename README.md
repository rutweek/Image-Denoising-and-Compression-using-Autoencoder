# Image-Denoising-and-Compression-using-Autoencoder (In Progress)
This Project Demonstrates use of Autencoders for Image Denoising and Compression  
## Autoencoders
Autoencoders are a specific type of feedforward neural networks where the input is the same as the output. They compress the input into a lower-dimensional code and then reconstruct the output from this representation. The code is a compact “summary” or “compression” of the input, also called the latent-space representation.
An autoencoder consists of 3 components: encoder, code and decoder. The encoder compresses the input and produces the code, the decoder then reconstructs the input only using this code.
